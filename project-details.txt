Project 1: ShiftGuard10: Robust Image Classification 
 
Dataset Description: 32�32 RGB images from 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck) 
- Training set: labeled images (train_images/) + labels file (train_labels.csv) 
- Test 	set: 	unlabeled 	images 	(test_images/) 	+ 	submission 	template 
(sample_submission.csv) 
- Class names: listed in classes.txt 
Task: Train a model using only the training data and predict the class label for each test image. 
Metric: Macro F1 (F1-score with macro averaging across 10 classes) 
Submission for code evaluation: Submit a Notebook that will generate a CSV with exactly two columns: 
- id: image id (e.g., 000001) 
- label: predicted class name (must be one of the 10 class names) 
 
Use sample_submission.csv as the template. Follow its formatting exactly.  
 
Rules 
1. Kaggle Team: 
- After joining the competition, one team member must send an invite to all other group members once they have also joined. 
- The team name should be the Group number, for example, �Group 1�.  
2. Notebook-only submissions 
- You must submit using a Kaggle Notebook (Notebook-based submission). 
- File upload-based submission is not allowed.  
- Do not upload a CSV generated outside Kaggle. 
- Your notebook must: 
- train the model from scratch 
- Run inference on the test set 
- Write the submission CSV 
3. No external data /no pretrained models 
- You may use only the competition data provided. 
- No external datasets, no extra images, no web data, no scraping. 
- The model must be trained from scratch. 
- No pretrained weights (ImageNet, self-supervised checkpoints, etc.). 
- No importing external checkpoints from Kaggle Datasets. - No external data /no pretrained models 
4. Reproducibility required: Your notebook must be reproducible: 
- include training + inference code 
- run end-to-end on Kaggle 
- avoid hidden manual steps 
5. Integrity/Fair Play 
- Do not attempt to reverse-engineer hidden labels. 
- Do not copy other teams� outputs. 
- Do not exploit loopholes in the evaluation process. Violations may lead to disqualification.
